# Covid and Life 

#### Problem description 
The BC government has placed a ban on group gatherings of more than 250 people. This is a good call, but is it enough?

This is a simple virus protocol which resembles Conaway's game of life (well, without the dying). 
To make this a little different, it is meant to examine how a virus spreads when a number of people are split into arbitrary group sizes with some amount of travel (e.g. 1000 people split into groups of 50, 250, 1000 people). 

This is moslty to experiement with Matplotlib animation looking at cool ways to display data/notebooks. 
Also with this whole quarantine thing I'm really bored
